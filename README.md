# Python-Numerical-Literal-Checker
 This project implements a Python program that recognizes valid Python literals, including decimal, octal, hexadecimal integers, and floating-point numbers. The program takes user input as a string and determines whether it is a valid literal based on the lexical definitions specified in the Python language reference.
